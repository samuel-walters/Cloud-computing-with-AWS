# S3

## What is S3?

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a scalable, high-speed, web-based cloud storage service. The service is designed for online backup and archiving of data and applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Storage Classes

### S3 Standard Class

 Use S3 if you need low latency or frequent access to your data. For example, if Netflix releases a new film, there will be a large number of people accessing and watching the film.

 ### S3 Glacier Class

 Use S3 Glacier for low storage cost, and when you do not require millisecond access to your data. For example, as the Netflix film becomes less popular, less people will watch it and so less people will be accessing its data.

 ## Advantages of S3

 ### Flexibility

 S3 does not ask what type of data you would like to store - python, photos, gifs, excel, sql, csv... it does not matter. Any format can be used and it will give it back to you in the same format.

## Cost-effective

S3 is very economical compared to the other databases. 

## Globally available - high availability

Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Points accelerate performance by up to 60% when accessing data sets that are replicated across multiple AWS Regions.

## Data recovery 

S3 can help form a part of the DR (disaster recovery plan) as it can back up data.
