# What is an AMI

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a supported and maintained image provided by AWS that provides the information required to launch an instance. It is used to create a virtual machine within the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ("EC2") without any manual set up.

## Use cases

* Terminating an instance is more cost-effective than stopping it. AMIs can cut down on costs as they ensure the user can terminate an instance without losing any work.

* If you are busy or away on holiday and a colleague needs to set up one of the instances you configured, all you have to do is use an AMI and send them the AMI's id along with some basic instructions such as the name of the security group.  

* You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI very quickly when you require multiple instances with the same configuration details.
